//! necore: the non-Euclidean engine core.

//! A world is a graph of convex polygonal rooms connected edge-to-edge by
//! invertible affine transforms. There is no world space: every coordinate is
//! room-local and only portal transforms relate rooms. The crate owns the
//! math that never changes -- geometry, visibility, simulation, queries --
//! and emits events; deciding what any of it *means* belongs to the game
//! layer above.
