"""Headless smoke test for the renderer: SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy, no window.

Builds the built-in 3-room debug level, drives 240 ticks of scripted input
(move + fire) through GameSession, feeds fx into Renderer.consume_fx every
tick, and draws onto a plain Surface every 30 ticks. Verifies the renderer
never raises, actually paints something (not a black frame), the player
silhouette is visible near screen center (camera always follows the
player), and draw() stays comfortably within budget. Saves the final frame
as a PNG for human/LLM inspection.
