"""Deterministic replay recording and playback for `GameSession` runs.

A `Replay` is the minimal data needed to reproduce a run bit-for-bit: the
level (embedded as `level_dict`, or referenced by `level_path`), the seed,
and the packed `InputFrame` row for every tick. Nothing about wall-clock
time, randomness outside `session.rng`/bot RNGs, or engine internals is
recorded — determinism comes entirely from `GameSession.tick` being a pure
function of (level, seed, input sequence).

`record()` drives a fresh session tick-by-tick via an `input_source`
callable (typically a bot's `.step`), capturing every `InputFrame`.
`play()` rebuilds a session from a `Replay` and re-runs it. Because both
paths go through `GameSession(level, seed=...)` -> `session.tick(inp)` with
identical inputs, `play(record(...)[1])` must land on the same final state
as the original run (see `game/tests/test_testkit.py`).
