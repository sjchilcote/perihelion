"""PERIHELION campaign generator.

Ten levels along the escalation curve of design_document_2.md §8.1:
deniable wrongness -> confirmable paradox -> overt impossibility -> pure graph.

Authoring style: rooms are drawn adjacent on the canvas; the level builder's
doorway-splitter turns any short wall segment shared with a longer wall into
an opening automatically. Impossible connections are added with connect_pts
(edge chosen by midpoint, resolved after splitting). no_connect keeps a
shared wall solid.

Run: uv run python tools/levelgen/campaign.py   (writes levels/*.json)
