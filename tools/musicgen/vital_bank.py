"""Vital goldmine — slot assignments + Vitalium render helpers.

Director's ruling 2026-07-15: ALL synth voices come from the Vital
banks ("if we use Vital patches that add their own detailed character,
the rudimentary nature of our sources becomes an asset rather than a
problem"). Delay Lama (the album's voice), the TR-909 kit, and the chug
wall stay — they're samples/the vocal, not synths.

SLOTS maps slot -> (bank, preset stem). Filled from preset_scout
results + name-flavor fit; every choice's runners-up live in the scout
scores JSON (the decision log's alternates).
