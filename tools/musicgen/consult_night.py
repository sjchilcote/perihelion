"""consult_night — GPT Sol consults: bot improvement + music elevation.

Director 2026-07-17 (overnight): "feed a bunch of data to GPT Sol
Ultra through openrouter - use the existing, working GPT consult
scripts... give it ALL information that could possibly be relevant -
and take everything it says with a grain of salt."

Two consults, each with maximal context, via consult_machinery's
streaming engine (crash-safe to disk):

    uv run python tools/musicgen/consult_night.py bot
    uv run python tools/musicgen/consult_night.py music
