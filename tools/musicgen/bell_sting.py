"""bell_sting — the sting bell, from a REAL bell (director 2026-07-17).

"That bell clip is NOT an appropriate stinger ... substitute for an
_on-key_ sample of a large bell ringing _once_ ... use the deepest
bell you can - get it down bordering on sub-bass territory."

Decent Sampler freeware -- sounds free for commercial use, instrument
itself not redistributable. The sample pack stays in the scratchpad
(never committed); only rendered stings ship. See SOURCES_LICENSES.md.

ChurchBell1.wav measured: perceived strike ~C5 (prime 530Hz, +22
cents), zero leading silence. We resample it down to a strike tone of
MIDI 38 + tonic root -- the same root the boss sub-bass lane is built
on (26 + r, one octave below), so the bell is on-key by construction
and its hum partial sits at ~37Hz: bordering on sub-bass.
