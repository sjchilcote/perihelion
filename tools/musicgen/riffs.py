"""Riff-ification — historical melody -> genre-native delivery. DATA ONLY.

The chant transcriptions are the SOURCE, not the performance. Direct
playback reads as "MIDI samples of historical melodies" (director,
2026-07-14). This module holds the delivery transforms:

- diminish: double/quad-time the line (chant quarters -> 8ths/16ths).
- riff_16: the Gordon/album idiom — a continuous 16th motor of
  palm-muted PEDAL notes with the melody's pitches landing as OPEN
  accents on a syncopated slot template. The tune's pitch order is
  preserved; the rhythm becomes the genre's.
- lead_phrase: diminished melody with anticipation pushes and held
  phrase-peaks — a lead performance, not a recitation.

Events: (semitone_from_final | None, dur_16th_steps) as everywhere.
riff_16 output adds articulation: (semi, steps, art) with art in
{"open", "mute"} for the renderer to map (open chug vs palm-mute,
full vs ghost velocity).
