# PERIHELION

A Teleglitch-style top-down survival shooter set aboard a station falling into
the sun — built on a non-Euclidean engine. The world is a graph of convex
polygons connected by portals that don't have to make sense: corridors loop onto
themselves, two wings occupy the same volume, a ward's south wall reflects
more than light. The game never tells you. You find out.

One seamless station: the campaign's ten decks stream in as you approach —
no loading screens, no level select, one continuous space from Dock 4 to the
Perihelion Core. Between decks, tight-beam relays carry a two-hander with
Ratio, the station's surviving mind — with choices, and a memory. Terminals
hold the crew's paper trail; some of what they logged was never explained.
Every shot counts.

## Running

Requires Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a Rust toolchain,
and a checkout of the engine's home repo,
[noneuclideantopdownshooter](../noneuclideantopdownshooter), as a sibling
directory — `necore` lives there (PERIHELION is built on top of it) and is
built once from here:

```bash
uv sync
uv run maturin develop --release -m ../noneuclideantopdownshooter/engine/necore-py/Cargo.toml
uv run python -m perihelion            # campaign (The Vigil is on the title menu)
uv run python -m perihelion --level levels/l06.json   # single level
```

### Assets are generated, not tracked

The repository holds code and text only — no images, audio, video, or fonts
(2026-07-28: they had bloated `.git` to 128 GB and were making every commit
spawn a repack). A fresh clone therefore has no textures, no sound bank, and
no music. Rebuild them:

```bash
uv run python tools/soundgen/bank.py       # the SFX bank (pure synthesis)
uv run python ../noneuclideantopdownshooter/tools/musicgen/generate_bank.py   # the music banks (musicgen lives with the engine repo)
uv run python tools/artgen/full_run.py     # polygon textures (needs an API key)
```

The game runs without them — silent and untextured — so a missing bank is
never a crash. `out/` and `media/` are working directories: capture banks,
films, and consult transcripts live there and are never committed.

Controls: WASD move, mouse aim, LMB fire, E interact/read, 1-8 or wheel to
switch weapons, ESC pause. RMB fires the lightning implant (when found) —
or, with the tau cannon in hand, holds a charge: release to discharge,
hold too long at your peril. The portable hole (slot 8) marks a wall per
click; two marks fold a corridor between them. Mind what fits through.

## Level editor

```bash
uv run python -m perihelion.editor              # new level
uv run python -m perihelion.editor levels/l03.json
```

## Architecture

- `../noneuclideantopdownshooter/engine/necore` — Rust core, in the engine's
  home repo: polygon-graph geometry, analytic portal visibility,
  deterministic physics with an event stream, portal raycasts, routing.
  Property-tested, including an oracle test that checks the non-Euclidean
  machinery against flat Euclidean geometry on levels where the two must
  agree. No world space exists anywhere: every coordinate is polygon-local;
  only portal transforms relate polygons.
- `../noneuclideantopdownshooter/engine/necore-py` — PyO3 bindings
  (module `necore`).
- `game/perihelion` — the game: deterministic `GameSession` (same level +
  seed + inputs ⇒ bit-identical run), immediate-mode lo-fi renderer at
  480×270, data-driven weapons/enemies, procedural audio, campaign.
- `game/perihelion/testkit` — replays, bot players, metrics, perf budgets:
  the game is designed to be playtested by machines (and was).
- `tools/levelgen` — campaign generator. `tools/soundgen` — the SFX bank is
  synthesized from scratch (numpy), verified by an AI listener.
- `levels/` — campaign JSON. See `ENGINE_DESIGN.md` for the full design.

## Development

```bash
./check.sh          # cargo test + rebuild engine + pytest
uv run python tools/playtest/run.py --level levels/l05.json --bot aggro
```

Design constitution: `design_document_2.md` §11. If a change violates an
invariant there, the change is wrong.

## Store copy (draft)

PERIHELION is a top-down survival shooter aboard a station falling into the
sun — one continuous, seamless station whose geometry is not Euclidean:
corridors loop back on themselves, mirror polygons reflect more than light,
and a sixteen-polygon tesseract deck runs on graph rules no floor plan can
draw. Ten decks stream past with no loading screen between the dock where
you make landfall and the core where it ends. Combat follows the Teleglitch
model — ammunition is scarce, engagements are short, and a mistake in a
corridor is usually the last one you make. The portable hole cuts a doorway
through any wall on command; the Cloister, a safe polygon folded into the
station's blind spots, is where you go when the hole isn't enough.

Ratio, the station's remaining rational mind, talks you deck to deck over a
tight-beam relay — and remembers how you answer. Trust her or needle her;
by the end, what she's willing to say depends on it. The crew is gone, but
their terminals aren't: work orders, watch logs, and transfer appeals that
add up to more than anyone logged on purpose. The tau cannon fires bolts
that bounce off portals the same way they bounce off walls, so the polygon
layout is part of the loadout. Hard mode makes everything tougher and
meaner; New Game+ starts the fall over with the arsenal you finished with.

- One seamless non-Euclidean station: mirror wards, infinite corridors, a
  tesseract deck — no loading screens, ever
- Teleglitch-style scarce-ammo survival combat
- Dialogue with memory: your answers move Ratio's trust, and her endgame
- A crew's worth of terminal lore with mysteries that don't resolve
- Portable hole: cut a doorway through any wall; retreat to the Cloister
- Tau cannon: bolts ricochet off portals
- THE VIGIL: an endless holdout mode on a fold arena
- Hard mode and New Game+
- Level editor included
- Sound design synthesized from scratch, tuned by ear
